Assignment 4 for Interactive Web Mapping and Spatial Data Visualization

Evictions that have occurred in Bushwick, Brooklyn filtered by year. Seeing this time trend will show the effect of the COVID-19 eviction moratorium.

Each eviction is a marker --> I want to update to circles that vary in size in case there were more than 1 eviction in 1 year at the same building. But first I need to look over and clean the data to get rid of duplicate entries that would skew this data viz.

Assignment Instructions: build a Mapbox GL JS web map about a topic of interest, making use of the techniques and tools we have covered in class and/or advanced techniques you have explored on your own.  You may build on previous work, or start with a new idea.  

* Be sure to think about the overall user experience, not just the map.
    -->Add slider so user can filter data by year

* Is it interesting/useful?  What will the user learn or discover?
    -->Year-to-year trends should show how 2021 was an anomaly, but people were stil being evicted

* Did you provide enough context and background information?
    -->Include legend to explain the moratorium

* Is it free of bugs, awkward states, and non-sequiturs?


* Add comments in your HTML, Javascript, and CSS files to annotate the code and help explain what it does


* Add a thorough README.md explaining the project, why you chose the topic, etc.  Add screenshots, links to the live site and relevant resources, etc.
